# Exercise - Going Serverless 

 

## Instructions 

 

Build a serverless framework (serverless.com) deployment that creates a Lambda, an S3 bucket, and a Dynamo DB table and uploads a file to your bucket. 
Then, write a plugin that invokes the Lambda after the deployment, extracts data from the file in S3 and inserts that data into DynamoDB. Be creative. Show off. Make it interesting. 

 

Feel free to implement in Node or Python.  

 

Please deliver all source code in the form of a git repo.
