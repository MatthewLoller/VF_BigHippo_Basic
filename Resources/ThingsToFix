Actually Wasted too much time on:
    scoping is weird in ForEach, having trouble looping through S3 objects. Decided to just settle with uploading single S3 for the MVP

Didnt Want to spend too much time on (I wouldnt go to production without):
    Unit/Integration Testing
    Storing environment variables in parameter store
    Creating VPC
    Creating VPC endpoint for Dynamo
    Creating VPC endpoint for S3
    Securing bucket policy to only allow request from potential VPC endpoint
    Possible better way to store AWS credentials? Since this is local .aws best thing might be a bastion...
